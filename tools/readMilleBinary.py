# Use the `-h` or `--help` command options to print out the full list of options.
# Here are a few helpful examples for what this script is helpful for.
#
# Select a Few Tracks:
#
# You can look at specific tracks by changing the number of records to print
# and the number of records to skip before starting to print. Perhaps, you know
# that the 100'th track is "bad" for some reason, then you could look at it and
# its neighbors with
#
#   ./readMilleBinary.py --num_records 3 --skip-records 99 input.bin
#
# Check Format:
#
# You can check the format of a mille data file by running over all the records
# and keeping the printout quiet.
#
#   ./readMilleBinary.py --num-records -1 --quiet input.bin
#
# If the format is correct, it will just printout the number of records and
# have an exit status of 0. If it is incorrect, it will print an error and
# have an non-zero exist status. *Warning*: The binary format cannot _by itself_
# distinguish between a file that has been broken at a record boundary
# and one that has successfully been closed correctly. For this reason, more 
# thorough testing will be needed by the user if they wish to eliminate this 
# possibility.
#
# Description of the output from readMilleBinary.py
#    -  Records (tracks) start with \c '===' followed by record number and length 
#       (<0 for binary files containing doubles)
#    -  Measurements: A measurement with global derivatives is called a 'global measurement', 
#       otherwise 'local measurement'. Usually the real measurements from the detectors are 'global'
#       ones and virtual measurements e.g. to describe multiple scattering are 'local'.
#    -  'Global' measurements start with \c '-g-' followed by measurement number, first global label,
#       number of local and global derivatives, measurement value and error. The next lines contain 
#       local and global labels (array('i')) and derivatives (array('f') or array('d')).
#    -  'Local' measurements start with \c '-l-' followed by measurement number, first local label, 
#       number of local and global derivatives, measurement value and error. The next lines contain
#       local labels (array('i')) and derivatives (array('f') or array('d')).

# Tested with SL4, SL5, SL6
#
# Used containers to manually test Python 2.7.18 and Python 3.11.2
#
#   - Install [distrobox](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/)
#     - source code: https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox
#   - Construct a distrobox for the desired python version
#       `distrobox create -i python:2 -n py2`
#   - Enter it to do test runs
#       `distrobox enter py2`
#
# One can check how this performs against a corrupted mille data file
# by using `dd` to intentionally only copy the first N bytes of a file.
#
#   dd count=10 if=uncorrupted.bin of=corrupted.bin
#
# will work if 'uncorrupted.bin' is greater than 512*10 bytes large.

# in Python2.7, we can use the beta version of the print function
#    imports from __future__ need to happen before any other code
